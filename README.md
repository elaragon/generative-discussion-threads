# Generative models of online discussion threads

<br/>Welcome to our [ICWSM-19 tutorial](https://icwsm.org/2019/program/tutorial/) on generative models of online discussion threads. The tutorial is based on the survey:

* [Aragón, P., Gómez, V., Garcı́a, D. & Kaltenbrunner, A. Generative models of online discussion threads: state of the art and research challenges. J. Internet Serv. Appl. 8, 15 (2017). DOI 10.1186/s13174-017-0066-z](https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13174-017-0066-z)

The notebook for the hands-on session is based on the [genthreads](https://github.com/alumbreras/generative-discussion-threads/) R package developed by [Alberto Lumbreras](https://github.com/alumbreras/) and then extended in collaboration with [Matteo Manca](https://github.com/matteomanca). The purpose is to provide tutorial attendeeds with computational and statistical tools to:

 * Represent data from online discussion threads using array structures
 * Visualize online discussion threads as tree networks
 * Apply different generative models of online discussion threads:
   * Gómez et al. 2013
   * Aragón et al. 2017
 * Validate generative models through structural properties:
   * Degree
   * Subtree (cascade) size 
   * Depth
